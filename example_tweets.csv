815260549881753600,jack,2016-12-31 18:17:16,RT @SquareAU: To our Australian sellers—thanks for letting us be a part of your journey. #Squarein2016 https://t.co/BayyUFprk9
814928235054190592,jack,2016-12-30 20:16:46,"Thanks for all your support and business! 2 years until @Square is 10, and we're excited to share what we've been up to!"
814926390520848384,jack,2016-12-30 20:09:26,New markets: we aspire to be a global service. But doing that with payments is slow going. Team is working to move faster
814926308987834368,jack,2016-12-30 20:09:07,Loyalty: we've tested a lot here and haven't found the right answer for all. Still working on this. Think we're now closer
814926158101905408,jack,2016-12-30 20:08:31,API: we are working hard this year to open more of our services up to developers!
814926071124660228,jack,2016-12-30 20:08:10,Bitcoin: we tried this with our ecommerce store years back. Didn't see much. Would love to see a digital currency thrive
814925877532303360,jack,2016-12-30 20:07:24,"And thanks for all the @Square feedback yesterday!  Asks we heard: bitcoin, API, loyalties, and more markets. https://t.co/pjFTn74d5d"
814925475965505537,jack,2016-12-30 20:05:48,We will be more open. Thanks for all your support and patience as we plan for the next 10 years of our service. And thanks to @bchesky!
814925203994185728,jack,2016-12-30 20:04:43,"The open exchange of information has a positive impact on the world, and that's why we're here. That starts with an open dialogue with you."

814924926759161857,jack,2016-12-30 20:03:37,Conversations: this is a big part of the magic of Twitter and currently really difficult to follow &amp; manage. We'll work to make this easier
814924574643126272,jack,2016-12-30 20:02:13,Topics: lots here but simply being able to follow topics was strongest request. Being more topic/interest-focused (v account) opens up a lot
814924317590962176,jack,2016-12-30 20:01:12,Edit: clearest ask was to provide a quick way to fix errors. Anything beyond requires showing edit history given tweets are public record
814924204235702272,jack,2016-12-30 20:00:45,Abuse: obviously a ton of work ahead but biggest ask was for greater transparency around our actions (or inaction) and faster shipping
